                <h2 class="center">Devil's Club Harvesting</h2>
                <p> The best time and place to harvest devil's club is the spring time and close to a stream or waterfall. Basically, when harvesting you cut at the the base of the stalk and is recommended that you pick the longer and thicker stalks, as it will be easier to peel.  </p>

              <h2 class="center">Medicinal Uses of Devil's Club and Medicine Making Process</h2>
              <p> Devil's club is used for variety of ailments including arthritis, cancer, wounds, fever, tuberculosis, stomach trouble, cough, colds, sore throat, diabetes, low blood sugar, and pneumonia. It is also used for emptying the bowels and causes vomiting.

              In this article I will focus on the process of medicine making.  </p>

                <h2 class ="center">Preparing the Stalks</h2>
                <div class="flex">
                <img src="image/dcscraping.PNG" width="200px" height="200"/>
                <p> Once you have harvested, you may scrape the needles and top skin off the stalks until you get to the inner green bark. If you have harvested in the Spring, you can slice down the middle of the stalk and peel off the inner bark from the core of the stalk.  If you have harvested at any other time of the year it is more difficult to peel off the inner layers (You may need the potatoe peeler to take the green coloured layers).  This green layer is the product that you will use to make your oil and salve.</p>

                <img src="image/dcpeel.PNG" width="200px"/>
                <p> You are now ready to make your medicine.  Once you have cut your green inner bark in little strips (about 4 inches)  You can fill your mason jars and add your oil until it is full to the rim.  Place the jar in a slow cooker or pot.  Fill the slow cooker with hot water and once it reaches a hot temperature, you may keep it on low tempature and let it sit overnight.  </p>

                <img src="image/dcoil.PNG" width="200px"/>
              <p>The morning after, you will be ready to place the oil into a pot and strain the excess oil using by placing the bark into a cheesecloth and squeezing it over a pot.  At this point you can add other elements of your choice, you can add other healing substances like comfrey, lavender, and vitamin E, vitamin C or tea tree.  At this point you can store the oil into small containers for later use, or you can use it to make salve.</P>
